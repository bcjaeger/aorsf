This article covers core features of the `aorsf` package. Separate articles will cover these features in more detail. 

## Background: ORSF

The oblique random survival forest (ORSF) is an extension of the axis-based RSF algorithm that can be found in several R packages, including `RandomForestSRC`, `party`, and `ranger`. 

## What is an oblique decision tree?

Decision trees are developed by splitting a set of training data into two new subsets, with the goal of having more similarity within the new subsets than between them. This splitting process is repeated on the resulting subsets of data until a stopping criterion is met. When the new subsets of data are formed based on a single predictor, the decision tree is said to be axis-based because the splits of the data appear perpendicular to the axis of the predictor. When linear combinations of variables are used instead of a single variable, the tree is oblique because the splits of the data are neither parallel nor at a right angle to the axis. 

```{r fig_oblique_v_axis, out.width='100%', echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Decision trees for classification with axis-based splitting (left) and oblique splitting (right). Cases are orange squares; controls are purple circles. Both trees partition the predictor space defined by variables X1 and X2, but the oblique splits do a better job of separating the two classes."}

## Accelerated ORSF

The purpose of `aorsf` ('a' is short for accelerated) is to provide routines to fit ORSFs that will scale adequately to large data sets. For example, `aorsf::orsf()` runs about 500 times faster than its predecessor, `obliqueRSF::ORSF()`.

To fit an accelerated ORSF model, use the `orsf` function:

```{r}

library(aorsf)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(329)

orsf_fit <- orsf(data_train = pbc_orsf, 
                 formula = Surv(time, status) ~ . - id, 
                 n_tree = 2500)

orsf_fit

```

you may notice that the first input of `aorsf` is `data_train`. This is a design choice that makes it easier to use `orsf` with pipes (i.e., `%>%` or `|>`). For instance,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

orsf_fit <- pbc_orsf |> 
 select(-id) |> 
 orsf(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ .)

```

In addition to their reputation for slow computing, oblique decision trees are considered less interpretable than their axis-based counterparts. The opinionated developer of `aorsf` disagrees with this sentiment, and has included routines in `aorsf` that use coefficients from linear combinations of input variables to estimate variable importance and identify pair-wise interactions.

### Variable importance

`aorsf` provides multiple ways to compute variable importance. 

- To compute negation importance, ORSF multiplies each coefficient of that variable by -1 and then re-computes the out-of-sample (sometimes referred to as out-of-bag) accuracy of the ORSF model. 

```{r}

variable_importance <- orsf_vi_negate(orsf_fit)

variable_importance

```


<!-- ### Variable interaction -->

<!-- ORSF's two-way interaction score for a pair of predictors is the proportion of variability in the coefficient of one predictor explained by the mean of the other. If one predictor's coefficient is highly correlated with another predictor's mean value, the two-way interaction score will be high (maximum value of the score is 1). If there is no correlation between the coefficient of one predictor and the mean value of another, the two-way interaction score will be low (minimum value of the score is 0). -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- variable_interaction <- orsf_interaction(orsf_fit) -->

<!-- variable_interaction[1:5, ] -->

<!-- ``` -->

### Partial dependence

`edema == 1` may modify the effect of `bili`. We can use the `orsf_pd_summary()` function (pd = partial dependence) to explore how these variables influence the expected prediction from ORSF.

```{r}

# make a list containing the variable values you
# want to compute partial dependence for
pd_spec <- list(edema = c("0", "0.5", "1"),
                bili = seq(0.6, 7.1, by = 0.1))

# orsf_pd_summary automatically computes pd for all combinations
# in the list (this can be turned off with expand_grid = FALSE)
pd_data <- orsf_pd_summary(object = orsf_fit, 
                           pd_spec = pd_spec,
                           expand_grid = TRUE)

ggplot(pd_data) +
 aes(x = bili, y = mean, col = edema) +
 geom_line() + 
 labs(y = 'Predicted risk',
      x = 'Bilirubin',
      title = 'Partial dependence of bilirubin and edema')

```

The presence of edema clearly impacts predicted risk, which makes it hard to see the interaction effect in this plot. Let's align the partial dependence values for the edema subgroups so that each curve will start at a value of 0 

```{r}

# aligning predictions at lowest value of bili
min_ed_0 <- with(pd_data, mean[edema == "0"   & bili == 0.6])
min_ed_1 <- with(pd_data, mean[edema == "0.5" & bili == 0.6])
min_ed_2 <- with(pd_data, mean[edema == "1"   & bili == 0.6])

pd_data_aligned <-
 within(pd_data, {
  value <- mean
  value[edema == "0" ] <- value[edema == "0" ] - min_ed_0
  value[edema == "0.5"] <- value[edema == "0.5"] - min_ed_1
  value[edema == "1" ] <- value[edema == "1" ] - min_ed_2
 })

head(pd_data_aligned)


```

With the aligned partial dependence values we can see the interaction effect clearly. Increasing bilirubin solicits a greater increase in predicted risk for patients with no edema (`edema == 0`), untreated edema (`edema == 0.5`), or successfully treated edema (`edema == 0.5`) compared to patients with therapy-resistant edema (`edema == 1`). 

```{r}

ggplot(pd_data_aligned) +
 aes(x = bili, y = value, col = edema) +
 geom_line() + 
 labs(y = 'Predictions centered at Bilirubin = 0.6',
      x = 'Bilirubin',
      title = 'Interaction between bilirubin and edema')

```

The similarity in trajectories for patients with `edema == 0` and `edema == 0.5` suggests that `edema == 1` has the strongest modifying effect of bilirubin. As a sanity check, we can fit a Cox regression model and conduct a likelihood ratio test for this interaction: 

```{r}

library(survival)

anova(coxph(Surv(time,status) ~ edema * bili, data = pbc_orsf))

```

The interaction p-value of 0.0208 above should not be interpreted in the usual way because it was not an apriori hypothesis, (I used other software to score every pairwise interaction in the data and picked one with a strong score). However, it is nice to see that an interaction identified by ORSF's partial dependence function is also identified with a traditional modeling strategy.

### Summarize ORSF models

Getting straight to variable importance and partial dependence in a direct way can often be helpful in exploratory analyses. When you want a lot of information for just a little code, `orsf_summarize_uni()` is the tool for you:

```{r}
orsf_summarize_uni(orsf_fit, n_variables = 5)
```

## What about the original ORSF?

The original ORSF (i.e., `obliqueRSF`) used `glmnet` to find linear combinations of inputs. `aorsf` allows users to implement this approach using the `orsf_control_net()` function: 

```{r}

orsf_net <- orsf(data_train = pbc_orsf, 
                 formula = Surv(time, status) ~ . - id, 
                 control = orsf_control_net(),
                 n_tree = 50)

```

`net` forests fit a lot faster than the original ORSF function in `obliqueRSF`. However, `net` forests are still about 100 times slower than `cph` ones:

```{r}

# tracking how long it takes to fit 50 glmnet trees
print(
 t1 <- system.time(
  orsf(data_train = pbc_orsf, 
       formula = Surv(time, status) ~ . - id, 
       control = orsf_control_net(),
       n_tree = 50)
 )
)

# and how long it takes to fit 50 cph trees
print(
 t2 <- system.time(
  orsf(data_train = pbc_orsf, 
       formula = Surv(time, status) ~ . - id, 
       control = orsf_control_cph(),
       n_tree = 50)
 )
)

t1['elapsed'] / t2['elapsed']


```
