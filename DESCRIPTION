Description: Oblique random survival forests incorporate linear combinations 
  of input variables into the recursive partitioning algorithm used to grow
  decision trees. The algorithm used to grow survival trees is the same as
  in random survival forests from Ishwaran, 2008 <doi:10.1214/08-AOAS169>. 
  A Newton Raphson scoring algorithm based on the Cox proportional hazard 
  model is used to identify linear combinations of input variables. Relative
  to obliqueRSF, the predecessor of aorsf, decision trees are grown about
  500 times faster.
