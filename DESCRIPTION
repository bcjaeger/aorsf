Description: Fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random
    survival forests. Oblique decision trees are notoriously slow compared
    to their axis based counterparts, but 'aorsf' runs as fast or faster than 
    axis-based decision tree algorithms for right-censored time-to-event 
    outcomes.
