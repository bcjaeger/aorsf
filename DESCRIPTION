Description: Oblique random survival forests incorporate linear combinations 
  of input variables into the recursive partitioning algorithm, a routine that
  is commonly used to grow decision trees. Oblique trees are usually more 
  effective in creating generalizable decision rules compared to their 
  axis-based counterparts, but the computational requirements of identifying
  oblique splits are usually much higher than that of an axis-based split. 
  Previous oblique decision tree algorithms embedded statistical models, e.g., 
  the Cox proportional hazards model, into nodes of a decision tree to identify
  linear combinations of input variables. A much faster approach utilized here
  is to apply incomplete Newton Raphson scoring based on Cox regression to 
  to identify linear combinations of input variables. In other words, complete
  1 iteration of the Newton Raphson algorithm and use the initial estimates
  of regression coefficients to derive a linear combination of inputs.
