\title{ORSF variable importance}
\usage{
orsf_vi(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class 'aorsf'.}
}
\value{
the \code{object} with variable importance attached.
}
\description{
ORSF variable importance
}
\details{
The method used to compute variable importance with ORSF is called
'negation importance'. Each variable is assessed separately by
multiplying the variable's coefficients by -1 and then determining
how much the model's performance changes. The worse the model's
performance after negating all coefficients for a given variable,
the more important the variable.
